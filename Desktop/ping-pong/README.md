## Description

This webpage is designed for the user to enter a number and if the number is divisible by 3 it will print "ping" instead of the number, and if the number is divisible by 5 it will print "pong", and if the number is divisible by 3 and 5, it will print "pingpong". The webpage also displays my github account where it will lead to other projects. This webpage is an exercise to practice using loops and arrays in JavaScript.
